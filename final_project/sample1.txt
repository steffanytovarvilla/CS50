In my capacity as the legal representative of Mr. SP. MOSQUERA MORENO JHON JAIRO, who is accused in the referenced case, and as a result of the finality of the ruling of the interlocutory order regarding his legal situation, in accordance with the content of Articles 360 and 521 of the Military Criminal Code, I respectfully submit and before the Military High Court, present this APPEAL against the decision made on August 14, 2019, through which the preventive detention measure was ordered for Mr. SP. MOSQUERA MORENO JHON JAIRO.

REASONS FOR DISSENT

The Court has outlined an extensive legal framework that guides the procedural aspects of the present case. Thus, regarding the need for a serious indication of responsibility, the argument has been based on the content of Article 522 of Law 522 of 1999:

"ARTICLE 522. MEASURES OF ASSURANCE AND SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS. The assurance measures for those who are imputable are a warning, a surety, and preventive detention, which will be applied when there is at least one serious indication of responsibility against the accused based on the legally produced evidence in the case."

Similarly, regarding the necessity of the measure, reference is made to Articles 454 and 466 of the new Military Penal Code, which are quoted below:

"ARTICLE 454. PURPOSE OF THE RESTRICTION OF FREEDOM. Personal freedom may be affected during proceedings when necessary to prevent obstruction of justice, ensure the appearance of the accused or defendant in the process, protect the community and victims, or for the enforcement of the custodial sentence."

…"ARTICLE 466. REQUIREMENTS. The military criminal judge, at the request of the Military Prosecutor, will order the assurance measure when, from the material evidence and physical evidence collected and secured, or from the legally obtained information, it can be reasonably inferred that the accused or defendant may be the author or participant in the criminal conduct being investigated, provided one of the following requirements is met:

That the assurance measure is necessary to prevent the accused from obstructing the proper administration of justice.
That the accused poses a danger to the safety of society, the victim, or the public forces.
That it is likely that the accused will not appear in the proceedings or will not comply with the sentence."
Finally, in a similar sense, the following excerpts from Law 906 of 2004, the new Code of Criminal Procedure, were cited:

"ARTICLE 308. REQUIREMENTS. The judge of guarantees control, at the request of the Attorney General or their delegate, will order the assurance measure when from the material evidence and physical evidence collected and secured, or from the legally obtained information, it can be reasonably inferred that the accused may be the author or participant in the criminal conduct being investigated, provided one of the following requirements is met:

That the assurance measure is necessary to prevent the accused from obstructing the proper administration of justice.
That the accused poses a danger to the safety of society or the victim.
That it is likely that the accused will not appear in the proceedings or will not comply with the sentence.
ARTICLE 309. OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. It will be understood that the imposition of the assurance measure is essential to prevent obstruction of justice when there are serious and well-founded reasons to infer that the accused may destroy, modify, direct, impede, conceal, or falsify evidence; or induce co-defendants, witnesses, experts, or third parties to provide false information or behave unfairly or evasively; or when it prevents or hinders the carrying out of proceedings or the work of the officials and other participants in the case."

ARTICLE 310. DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY. In order to assess whether the accused’s freedom is dangerous to the community’s safety, in addition to the severity of the crime and the penalty, the following circumstances must be considered:

The continuation of the criminal activity or its probable connection to criminal organizations.
The number of crimes the accused is charged with and their nature.
Whether the accused is subject to a measure of assurance or enjoying a substitute for a custodial sentence for a wilful or preterintentional crime.
The existence of valid convictions for wilful or preterintentional crimes.
ARTICLE 311. DANGER TO THE VICTIM. It will be understood that the victim’s safety is at risk due to the accused's freedom when there are well-founded reasons to infer that the accused may harm the victim, their family, or their property.

ARTICLE 312. NON-APPEARANCE. To decide on the potential non-appearance of the accused, in addition to the type and severity of the crime and the penalty, the following must be considered:

Lack of ties to the community, determined by the domicile, family residence, business, or workplace, and the ease with which the accused could leave the country or remain hidden.
The severity of the damage caused and the attitude of the accused towards it.
The behavior of the accused during the procedure or in previous proceedings, from which it can be reasonably inferred their unwillingness to comply with the investigation, criminal prosecution, and sentence enforcement."
Having contextualized the procedural limits for the decision under controversy, the Court applied the appropriate legislation in accordance with Law 906 of 2004. Accordingly, based on the development of this regulation, to assess the appropriateness of imposing a preventive assurance measure, it is imperative to first examine the assertion of liberty contained in Article 295 of the aforementioned regulation, which states the following:

"ARTICLE 295. ASSERTION OF FREEDOM. The provisions of this code that authorize the preventive deprivation or restriction of the accused’s freedom have an exceptional character; they may only be interpreted restrictively, and their application must be necessary, adequate, proportional, and reasonable in relation to constitutional content."

It is indisputable, therefore, to understand that in accordance with the above article, the starting point for the imposition or not of an assurance measure is the conception of LIBERTY AS A GENERAL RULE and its limitation as an exceptional measure, understanding that it MUST be:

Necessary: It requires that, of all possible means of the same effectiveness, the state authority chooses the least restrictive of rights.
Adequate: The restrictive means of individual rights must be suitable for achieving the goal of fulfilling the proposed constitutional end, as it is unacceptable to impose any limitation if it does not meet the constitutional purpose cited by the authority.
Proportional: The limitation of the fundamental right, i.e., liberty, that the imposition entails, must be: I. suitable for achieving one of the constitutional purposes justifying it, i.e., the safety of society and the victims, the effectiveness of justice administration, and/or the appearance of the accused; II. necessary for this same effect, as explained earlier; and III. balanced, meaning the severity of the restriction is no greater than necessary to satisfy the principle(s) intended to be promoted by the set goals.
Reasonable: Sensible and logical according to constitutional content.
