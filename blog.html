            <h2> 13 Jan 2025. From the Courtroom to Code: My Journey into Programming</h2>
            <p class="justified-text">Life often takes us on unexpected journeys, and mine has been
                 no exception. For years, I dedicated myself to the world of law, 
                 working as a criminal lawyer and public defender. It was a career
                   filled with challenges and immense personal growth. I advocated for justice,
                    represented individuals in their most vulnerable moments, and honed skills in
                     analysis, argumentation, and decision-making. But as fulfilling as my legal 
                     career was, I realized something profound: I was ready to explore a new frontier.</p>
                
                <h4>Leap into Programming</h4> 
                <p class="justified-text">The transition from law to programming might seem unusual, even
                 drastic, but for me, it felt like a natural evolution. The Harvard CS50 course ignited a curiosity
                  in me that I hadn’t experienced in years. Programming introduced me to a world of logic, creativity,
                   and problem-solving that paralleled my experiences as a lawyer. Each line of code became a puzzle to
                    solve, and each project felt like arguing a case, where precision and critical thinking were the keys
                     to success.</p>
                
                <h4>The Wonder of New Possibilities</h4>
                <p class="justified-text">One of the most remarkable aspects of opening myself to a new field has been
                 the realization of just how many opportunities exist when you step outside your comfort zone. Programming,
                  much like law, is about creating solutions and helping others, but it allows for a level of innovation and
                   collaboration that is incredibly exciting. This journey has taught me the importance of being open to change
                    and embracing the unknown. Starting something new isn’t always easy, but it’s within those moments of discomfort
                     that we grow the most.</p>
                
                <h4>Why Exploring Matters</h4>
                <p class="justified-text">When we allow ourselves to explore, whether professionally or personally, we discover
                 not just new skills but also new aspects of who we are. I’ve learned to appreciate the overlap between my legal expertise
                  and my programming knowledge. Skills like critical thinking, attention to detail, and perseverance have seamlessly transferred
                   into this new field, proving that no experience is ever wasted.</p>
                
                   <h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>
                   <p class="justified-text">If there’s one message I’d like to share from my journey, it’s this: never be afraid to reinvent yourself.
                     Life is too short to stay confined to one path when there’s an entire world of possibilities waiting to be explored. Whether it’s 
                     learning to code, starting a business, or pursuing a passion, the leap might be daunting, but the rewards are immeasurable.</p>
                
                     <p class="justified-text">This is just the beginning of my story as a programmer, and I’m excited to see where it takes me. To anyone
                         considering a change, know this: the first step is the hardest, but it’s also the most transformative.</p>
